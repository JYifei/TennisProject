# TennisProject
Tennis analysis using deep learning and machineÂ learning

### Ball detection
TrackNet was used for detecting tennis ball during the game. For more information you can check this repository: https://github.com/yastrebksv/TrackNet. There you can find 
pretrained weights to check the model.

### Bounce detection
CatBoostRegressor was used to predict ball's bounces during the game based on ball trajectory detected in the previous step. You can check this pretrained model: 

### Court detection
It was used neural network for detection 14 points of tennis court. For more information you can check this repository: https://github.com/yastrebksv/TennisCourtDetector. There you can find pretrained weights to check the model.
