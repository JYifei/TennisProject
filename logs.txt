Using HALPE_26 model (body and feet) for pose estimation.

No valid CUDA installation found: using OpenVINO backend with CPU.

Pose tracking set up for "body_with_feet" model.
Mode: balanced.

Persons are detected every 4 frames and tracked inbetween. Multi-person is selected. Tracking is done with sports2d.
keypoint_likelihood_threshold=0.3, average_likelihood_threshold=0.5, keypoint_number_threshold=0.3
Skipping right wrist angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the model: ['RElbow', 'RWrist', 'RIndex'].
Skipping left wrist angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the model: ['LElbow', 'LIndex', 'LWrist'].

Post-processing pose:
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Pose in pixels saved to G:\TennisProject\demo_Sports2D\demo_Sports2D_px_person00.trc.
- Person 1: Less than 4 valid frames. Deleting person.
- Person 2: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Pose in pixels saved to G:\TennisProject\demo_Sports2D\demo_Sports2D_px_person02.trc.

Converting pose to meters:
Using height of person #0 (1.7m) to convert coordinates in meters. Floor angle: auto (estimation: -36.27бу), xy_origin: auto (estimation: [0, -46]).
Person 0: Pose in meters saved to G:\TennisProject\demo_Sports2D\demo_Sports2D_m_person00.trc.

Post-processing angles:
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Correcting segment angles by removing the -36.27бу floor angle.
